Summary:
========

This directory contains the source code for a experimental OS called PowerOS,
which I ported to the Raspberry PI as an educational OS. 
It is partly inspired by the good old AmigaOS, but it is not compatible. Some
Functions are the same others dont. So dont rely on it.

Status:
=======

At the moment the exec.library (80% complete) there, but still not finished. Semaphores are missing
and the allocmem routines dont make me happy. There is also a first version of the
timer.device (80% complete). One of the cool functions in timer.device missing is the 
WAITFOR_UNITHZ.
I will try to add more and more features to the next releases. At the moment im sitting
on USB support, SDHCI support. After that, I will try to get the old PowerDOS library to work
with the nil: ram: and fastfiling system handlers. Perhaps console.device will be somewhere in
between.
Last libraries/devices which will be consequently added are:
- intuition
- input
- keyboard
- mouse
- serial
- graphics
- bootmenu
- audio

Directory Hierarchy:
====================

/src
	/raspi -> all raspi related stuff, but its mixed with exec, so in future this directory will perhaps vanish and all will go to exec.
	/kickstart -> all "ROM" Files will be stored here
		/lib.exec -> Exec.library, heart of the OS, with Messages, Tasks,...
		/dev.timer -> timer.device, with this, you can ask for time, create stopwatches and get accurate time through e_time function (1.000.000hz)
		
System Initialization:
----------------------

The Raspberry Pi boots up a VideoCore, after that, it loads a kernel.img from SDCard and executes it on adress 0x8000. This is all accomplished in
the platform.c in the raspi directory
